# How to Get Unbanned on Destiny 2 (2025 Guide) 🌟

Getting banned from Destiny 2 can really feel like a Major Arcana killer, especially if you’re convinced it was an accidental strike. This quick guide will help you understand what steps to take if your account got flagged and how to appeal your ban for the best shot at joining the Guardian ranks again.

## Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️

Did your ban hit you the moment you rolled a fresh character, or does it follow you across multiple new accounts? You might be **HWID banned** (Hardware ID Ban)! Destiny 2 has locked down your PC’s hardware ID, making it tricky to jump back into the Tower on any new accounts.

A trusty HWID spoofer might just be the ghost you need to slip past this hardware ban and play again.

## Step 1: Understand Why You Were Banned ❓

Check any emails or notifications from Bungie or Destiny 2 to discover the reason behind your ban. Usual suspects include:
- Cheating or using unauthorized third-party software  
- Toxic behavior or harassment in the Crucible  
- Sharing accounts or suspicious login activity  

**Tip:** Always review the Bungie Code of Conduct before you submit an appeal.
